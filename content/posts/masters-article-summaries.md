## TL;DR

- Replay attacks remain the easiest ASV spoofing vector; DL-RAD, autoencoders + Siamese networks, and CQCC features significantly improve detection.
- ASVspoof 2021 pushes detection into real-world, noisy settings requiring domain generalisation.
- Remote sensing (NEON/NIST) mirrors the need for multi-source data fusion—hyperspectral, LiDAR, RGB—for ecological insights.

## 1. Replay Attack Detection Based on Distortion by Loudspeaker

- **Source**: Ren et al., _Multimedia Tools and Applications_, 2019. DOI: 10.1007/s11042-018-6834-3.
- **TL;DR**: DL-RAD detects replay attacks by analysing loudspeaker-induced distortions (low-frequency attenuation, harmonic energy).
- **Highlights**: Harmonic Energy Ratio, Low Spectral Variance. Achieves >98% detection accuracy.
- **Application**: voice authentication systems (mobile, banking). Focus on dependable feature extraction.
- **Reflection**: Consider how speaker hardware signatures can serve as anti-spoof signals.

## 2. ASVspoof 2021: Deepfake Speech Detection in the Wild

- **Source**: ASVspoof 2021 challenge; TASLP 2023 paper (DOI: 10.1109/TASLP.2023.3285283).
- **TL;DR**: Evaluates spoofed/deepfake detection in noisy, uncontrolled environments; introduces large-scale dataset.
- **Highlights**: Variance across capture devices, environmental noise; combination of spectrogram analysis and deep models.
- **Application**: deploy robust detectors for real-world ASV systems, banking, call centers.
- **Reflection**: emphasises the need for adaptive models and domain generalization.

## 3. NIST DSE Plant Identification with Remote Sensing

- **Source**: NIST publication on airborne remote sensing data challenge.
- **TL;DR**: Integrates hyperspectral, LiDAR, RGB data to segment tree crowns, align field data, classify species.
- **Highlights**: data fusion, scaling ecological monitoring, addressing heterogeneous resolutions.
- **Application**: environmental monitoring, conservation, precision agriculture.
- **Reflection**: parallels with multi-modal data integration in other domains (e.g., security sensors).

## 4. Replay Spoofing Countermeasure Using Autoencoder & Siamese Networks (ASVspoof 2019)

- **Source**: Adiban et al., _Computer Speech & Language_, 2020. DOI: 10.1016/j.csl.2020.101105.
- **TL;DR**: Combines autoencoders (denoising) with Siamese networks (similarity) to detect replay attacks.
- **Highlights**: CQCC features, improved EER by 10.73%, t-DCF drop of 0.2344.
- **Application**: mobile authentication, payment systems, secure access.
- **Reflection**: underscores the power of hybrid feature + metric-learning approaches.
