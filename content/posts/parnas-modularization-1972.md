## Abstract

David L. Parnas (1972) proposed information hiding as the primary criterion for modular design, using the KWIC (Key Word In Context) system to compare traditional flow-based modularization vs encapsulating design decisions. His approach yields systems that are easier to modify, maintain, and evolve.

## Key points

- Traditional modularization (aligned with processing steps) leads to high coupling and brittle systems.
- Information hiding: modules encapsulate design decisions (data structures, algorithms, storage formats).
- KWIC case study: conventional design (5 modules aligned with processing sequence) vs information-hiding design (4 modules for storage, circular shift generation, sorting, output).
- Benefits: localized changes, clear responsibilities, replaceable internals without breaking clients.
- Trade-off: potential performance overhead due to inter-module communication; can be mitigated via inlining and efficient call mechanisms.

## Connections

- Precursor to object-oriented encapsulation and modern modular design.
- Supports microservices and DDD bounded context thinking.
- Relates to clean architecture and low coupling principles.
- Anticipates interface contracts in modern API design.

## Questions

- How to apply information hiding in fast-paced agile projects?
- Which metrics can quantify effective information hiding?
- How to balance encapsulation with performance in real-time systems?
- Applicability to distributed architectures?

## Personal reflections

- Encapsulating design decisions prevents leakage of implementation details across layers.
- KWIC example illustrates how storage strategies can remain swappable with proper abstraction.
- Critique of flow-based modularization still relevant for ETL/data pipeline architectures.
- Stable interfaces support DevOps pipelines and isolate testing concerns.
