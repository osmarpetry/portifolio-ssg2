## Overview

Bill Kennedy adapts Domain-Driven Design principles to Go by emphasising data flow and simplicity. DDDOD keeps the focus on reliable data transformations while preserving idiomatic Go patterns.

## Why not pure DDD?

- Traditional DDD can introduce excessive abstraction and ceremony in Go projects.
- Too many layers and interfaces obscure intent, reducing maintainability.

## Core pillars

- **Data-oriented design**: prioritise data models and their transformations; ensure data can cross layers safely.
- **Validation & trust**: embed validation logic early; fail fast to maintain integrity.
- **Structured layers**: app → business → storage; each layer defines clear contracts and side-effects.
- **Domain isolation**: separate bounded contexts to prevent accidental coupling and cascading failures.

## Implementation tips

- Use packages to reflect domains (`internal/user`, `internal/auth`); avoid grab-bag packages like `common`.
- Expose only necessary APIs; keep implementation details private.
- Guard entry points with validation and logging to catch anomalies early.
- Leverage functional options or constructors to initialize services with dependencies explicitly.
